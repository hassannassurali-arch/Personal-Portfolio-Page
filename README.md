## Deploying (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `hassan-portfolio`.
2. Upload `index.html`, `style.css`, `images/` and this `README.md`.
3. On GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages** (or "Pages" in repo settings), select branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`, then Save.
4. After ~1–2 minutes your site will be available at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/hassan-portfolio`.
5. Paste that repo link + live URL to your trainer before the deadline.

## Quick edits you should do before submit
- Replace `images/profile.png` and `images/project-1.png` with real images.
- Update the email in the contact form `action="https://formsubmit.co/your.email@example.com"` to your email.
- Optionally change copy (About, Projects) to reflect real info.

## Notes / Tips
- The project is intentionally single-page (assignment #1). If you later want a multi-page site for a portfolio, we can expand it — but submit this single-page version for the assignment.
- For extra polish: add small JS for smooth-scrolling or an animated PDF resume link (optional; not required).
